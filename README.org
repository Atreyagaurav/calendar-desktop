* Calendar Desktop
  This is a simple program that prints out the calendar days into the output. It can currently only format the output for the conky desktop output system.
  I'll later add other options like the terminal ANSII colors and no color system.

  I'll also later add the feature of saving your schedules in a file so that the calendar can show it. I'd like for it to be synced to the google calendar or sth, but I'm not sure I can handle that so it'll have to be manual and minimalistic for now.
